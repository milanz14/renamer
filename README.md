### Renamer

- Command line tool for renaming file extensions

### How does it work

- Rename takes in the expected extension name and a second extension name
- it will review all files in the directory if they match the input extension

`node renamer.js png jpg`

- the above code would rename every png into jpg

### How to review

`git clone` this repository
`cd renamer`
`drag/copy your files over into the root directory`
`to convert files, follow the instructions as per the 'How does it work' section`
